# Discord-Bot
This project I started a few months ago and finally got it completely working and running on my home server at all times.
This bot includes fun commands such as responding to '!hello' or '!greet' with pre made responses.
This is still a work in progress as I will continue to add more commands for the streamer this bot was created for.
